There were so many great tracks from 2018 it was hard to narrow it down to just 25 (plus 5 honorable mentions). Hundreds of artists this year showcased a vast range of producing chops that both kept true to trap’s roots and also allowed for growth in a genre that has already expanded in so many different directions.

Hey everybody! I'm looking to hire somebody to create some rough sketches of weapon/instrument hybrids for use for Bard characters. I've got a budget of about  this time (I've got some significant wiggle room if needed), and I've got a couple ideas of what I'd be interested in seeing come to use as a reference for larger pieces in the (probably distant) future. The first piece that I'd want to see, specifically, is a vihuela de arco (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vihuela) or treble.

Dear Jax, You’ll never believe the day I had today. You know how hard it’s been finding steady work since coming back to Waterdeep. I still can’t bring myself to join a mercenary unit or one of those thug crews. I want a real \ adventure\ not wasting my time vexxing the Watch or fighting as some other man’s tough.

This is a standalone excerpt from Sorrentino's Mulligan Stew (Dalkey Archive Press, 1996), presented as a story by the hapless Lamont, proudly enclosed in a letter to a professor who is thinking of using his work in a literature course: gt What, then, did he like, what were the things we were able to ascertain about him from a perusal of his private papers and diaries Welcome to the 81st Lets Build !

Hello everyone, and welcome back to For Your Consideration, the weekly series where we talk about albums that aren't on our Essentials chart (2012 discussion coming soon? idk), and maybe why they should be. This week, /u/NonNewtonianFigs is stepping in to talk about Syd Matters' Brotherocean  Artist: Syd Matters (https://fanart.tv/api/download.php?type=downloadampimage=159093ampsection=2) Album: Brotherocean (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lCLp3UneQI0/maxresdefault.jpg).

Snare reverb, reversed reverb, gated reverb or many other reverbs are simply added based on our creative vision. Trying to find out which back issue had the comic Entropy in it.

It will be hard for you to compare and contrast between something that changes significantly from person to person. One Sikh told me the following. I absolutely love folk and instrumental metal. I'm trying to amass a collection of obscure percussion, woodwind, and stringed instruments I can play for my music. I already have electric and acoustic guitar down, but I need some ideas for stuff like flutes. I'm already planning on a set of steel pan drums, a ukulele, and a tin whistle. However, the one instrument I ~~want~~ need is the flute in the intro of this song by Iron Mask (https://youtu.be/OnsBV7aPQHI?t=45s). I can't seem to place.
