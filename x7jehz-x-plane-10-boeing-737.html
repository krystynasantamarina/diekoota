I watched a documentary about the DC-10 a while ago, and remember that it was grounded for a month or so in 1979. The DC-10 was grounded due to a single crash that was caused by poor maintenance. Back in 1979, there was no internet, and I'm assuming information about the plane didn't spread as much as with the internet. However, it does seem like the incident did tarnish the image of McDonnell-Douglas and trijets altogether without the internet. So with that in mind, is the 737 MAX grounding. –ó–∞—á–µ–º —Ç–∞–º –Ω–∞–∫–ª–µ–π–∫–∏. –ö—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏, –∫–æ–∫–ø–∏—Ç —É –Ω–µ–≥–æ, –Ω–∞ –º–æ–π –≤–∑–≥–ª—è–¥, —Å–∞–º—ã–π –∞—Ç–º–æ—Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞ –≤—Å—é –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é —Å–∏–º—É–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≤. –ü—Ä–µ–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω—ã –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞–Ω—ã —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—Ä—ã –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–ø–æ—Ä—Ü–∏–∏.

For X-Plane 10 & 11 - EADT X737: These are superb aircraft, all the more astonishing because they are freeware, and both versions (737-700 and 737-800) are available with several liveries, and come complete with highly detailed virtual cockpits. ### Flat Earthers (or Flerfers) are not about popular physics or even the shape of the planet, they are a protest movement (created by the government) against NASA's obviously flawed (and hopelessly corrupt) universe modal. Govt does this all the time. It's called Controlled Opposition. So what is NASA hiding with it's fake Flat Earth Movement which enjoys endless media coverage? NASA is a #sciencefiction created after WW2 to hide the secrets of the world: The earth is a hollow #dysonsphere.
